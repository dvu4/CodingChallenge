To be sure, no one is accusing authors like Albain of racism, 
and people on both sides of the debate want to save lives. 
But the treatment of race by some medical researchers continues to create a stir. 
Lisa Carey, a breast cancer specialist at the University of North Carolina, believes that biological differences may well contribute to differences in health, 
such as the one Albain found, but that any discussion of race turns automatically contentious. 
"The idea of differences between races has been fraught with misuse over the years, and not just in medicine. 
Everyone is leery that it could be misused again," she says. "So we have to be careful how we interpret it, 
but that doesn't mean we should ignore it."
