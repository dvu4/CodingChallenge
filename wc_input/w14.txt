The controversy resurfaced in July with the publication of a study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) 
in which researchers analyzed more than 19,000 patients who participated in clinical trials involving treatments for a variety of cancers. 
The paper found that all other factors being equal, black patients had on average a significantly lower cancer survival rate than whites. 
Given that all patients were participating in the same clinical trials, the authors said, there was no difference in terms of access to care. 
Researchers said also that even after adjusting for patients' socioeconomic status, the survival gap between black and white patients remained 
for three of the cancers studied: breast, ovarian and prostate. "There is a considerable difference in the statistics. 
Something big is going on among people who are getting equal care," says lead author Kathy Albain, 
a breast and lung cancer specialist at Loyola University's cancer center. That something, the authors concluded, 
must be some unknown biological or genetic factor that differs by race.
