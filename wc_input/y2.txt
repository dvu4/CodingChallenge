For Albain's part, she says race is a surrogate for unknown genes — which, scientists agree, play a significant role in health outcomes. 
"When we find out what the [genetic] 'it' is, we will be able to test everyone for 'it' and we will find some Caucasians who have it and 
some blacks who don't and we won't be talking about black and white anymore," she says. Still, geneticists point out that hereditary 
traits follow ancestral lines, not racial ones. And race in America, as it is socially defined, constitutes such broad categories that 
it is a crude — arguably useless — proxy for genetics.

Yet such studies insistently conclude that, having controlled for socioeconomics, there must be some unknown biological factor 
(as opposed to some unknown social or cultural factor) at play, says David Williams, a Harvard professor of public health and African American studies. 
"The biology is a fall-back black box that many researchers use when they find racial differences," he says. 
"It is knee-jerk reaction. It is not based on science, but on a deeply held, cultural belief about race that the medical field has a hard time giving up."
