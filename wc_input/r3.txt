That conclusion, critics quickly responded, was flawed. "Race is a sociological concept, 
not a biological category," says Otis Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, 
who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. "But this study brings race into medicine as a biological categorization.
" According to the Human Genome Project, people are indeed well over 99% identical; at the molecular level race is imperceptible. 
But even while Albain's and other similar studies don't do much to shift the prevailing medical opinion — that disparities 
in health are fueled mainly by socioeconomics and access to care — they remind us that antiquated and unscientific ideas about race are alive 
and well in medical research in America.
