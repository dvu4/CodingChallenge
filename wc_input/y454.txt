This is a uniquely American phenomenon, experts say. In other countries, 
information about race is usually not available to medical researchers, 
as it isn't collected in census data or in birth and death certificates. 
In some countries, such as Canada, medical researchers can choose to ask about race, 
but in other places — France, for example — researchers have a hard time winning approval for any study that 
specifically involves participants' race. Meanwhile, in the U.S., not only is racial data ubiquitous, 
its inclusion is mandated by the government in certain medical studies. 
The 1994 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act calls for the reporting of 
racial differences when analyzing treatment effects in clinical trials.

It is that pattern of categorization that makes possible the approval of drugs like Bidil, 
a heart failure drug that became the first U.S. medication to be approved and marketed expressly for black people, 
in 2005. But after approval, a deeper look at the research showed that clinical trials of Bidil — 
a combination of two generic heart drugs — involved only self-described African Americans, 
and that the drug was not useful for all blacks and very useful for some whites. In other words, 
the utility of the first race-based drug was not defined by race at all.
