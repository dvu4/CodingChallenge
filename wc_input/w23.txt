While the rest of the country wrangled over the behavior of police officers in the wake of the Henry Louis Gates arrest last month, 
some scientists were pulling out their hair over racial profiling of a different kind: that perpetrated by medical researchers. 
Experts within the research community say a small but stubborn streak of racial profiling has long persisted in the medical literature, 
borne out in studies that attribute health disparities between blacks and whites not to socioeconomics or access to health care alone 
but also to genetic differences between the races — a concept that implies that a biological category of race exists.
